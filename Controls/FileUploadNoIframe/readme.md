# FileUploadNoIframe

This is an experimental implementation of the `FileUpload` control that doesn't use iframe on the background. Works even in IE11.

## Sample 1: Something

The usage is the same as in the official [FileUpload](https://www.dotvvm.com/docs/controls/builtin/FileUpload/2.0) control:

```DOTHTML
<dc:FileUploadNoIframe UploadedFiles="{value: MyFiles}" />
```
